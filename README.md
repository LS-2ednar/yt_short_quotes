# Youtube Short System

## GENERAL CONCEPT
1) Content generation using webscrapers that collect multiple quotes from different locations and store them in a database.
2) Generate a AI Voice for text to speach.
3) Generate automated videos. -> use ffmpeg seems to be sufficient for what I want to do :-)
4) upload the combined videos to youtube and set a schedule to when the video should be run
